## What is Web Wizardry?

**web wizardry** is a radical approach to web development that brings the power of POSIX shell scripts to the browser. Instead of complex JavaScript frameworks and heavyweight backend languages, web wizardry uses:

- **Shell scripts** for all server-side logic
- **Pandoc** to convert Markdown to HTML
- **htmx** for seamless interactivity
- **nginx** for serving and CGI execution
- **No databases** - the filesystem IS the database

## Architecture

```
Browser Request
    ↓
nginx (web server)
    ↓
fcgiwrap (CGI adapter)
    ↓
Shell Script in spells/.imps/cgi/
    ↓
Execute POSIX commands
    ↓
Generate HTML response
    ↓
htmx swaps content
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Filesystem as Database**
No SQL, no NoSQL - just files and directories. Simple, auditable, version-controllable.

### 2. **Reproducible Builds**
Delete the `build/` directory and rebuild - you'll get identical HTML every time.

### 3. **Real Shell Scripts**
Every interactive feature is a real POSIX shell script. You can:
- Use standard UNIX tools (`grep`, `awk`, `sed`)
- Pipe commands together
- Write functional, tested code

### 4. **No Hidden Complexity**
What you see is what you get:
- Markdown files → HTML pages
- Shell scripts → Interactive features
- Static files → Served as-is

### 5. **Secure by Default**
- CGI execution restricted to one directory
- File uploads isolated
- HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- No code injection vulnerabilities from shell scripts (proper escaping)

## Why Shell Scripts?

Shell scripts are:
- **Universal** - Every UNIX system has `sh`
- **Transparent** - Easy to read and audit
- **Powerful** - Access to all system tools
- **Fast** - No runtime overhead
- **Educational** - Learn UNIX while building sites

## This Demo Site

This entire demo site is built with web wizardry:

- **15+ interactive demos** - All powered by shell CGI scripts
- **Multiple pages** - Navigation, content organization
- **Custom components** - Reusable card layouts
- **Real-time updates** - No page reloads needed
- **Pure shell backend** - Zero JavaScript on the server
- **Multi-room chat** - MUD-compatible chat system with `.log` files

## Get Started

```bash
# Create a new site
web-wizardry create mysite

# Edit content
vim ~/sites/mysite/site/pages/index.md

# Build
web-wizardry build mysite

# Serve
web-wizardry serve mysite
```
